# DORIC_multiple_files_with_footshock_onset_IC

This R script automates the extraction of fluorescence and digital input (DIO) data from multiple `.doric` fiber photometry files.  
It is designed for experiments involving **footshock delivery**, where the onset of each shock is detected from DIO signals.  
The script organizes all input files, exports clean CSVs for signal channel, control channel, and shock onset timestamps csv for downstream analyses (in Guppy).

**Dependencies:** `rhdf5`

## ‚öôÔ∏è What the script does

1. Searches the working directory for all `.doric` files.  
2. Creates an organized folder structure:
   - Moves raw `.doric` files into `/DORIC_files/`
   - Creates a separate output folder for each recording
3. Extracts and exports:
   - **Signal channel:** `/LockInAOUT01/AIN01`
   - **Control channel:** `/LockInAOUT02/AIN01`
   - **DIO (shock onset):** `/DigitalIO/DIO01`
4. Detects **footshock onsets** by identifying rising edges (transitions from 0 ‚Üí 1) in the DIO trace.
5. Outputs clean `.csv` files for:
   - `<basename>_Signal.csv`  
   - `<basename>_Control.csv`  
   - `<basename>_Shocks.csv` (only if shocks detected)

## üìÅ Output structure

For each `.doric` file (e.g., `Session1.doric`), the following folder and files are created:
